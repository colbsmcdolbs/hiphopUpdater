# hiphopUpdater
A service that will announce to you when new Hip Hop albums are released.

[See us in action](https://hiphopupdater.herokuapp.com/)

hiphopUpdater is a web application built in Python using the Flask web-framework. The service allows users to Subscribe to certain Rappers and be notified of whenever a new album, mixtape, song or album is released by them. This is done by a webscraper that harvests data from the Subreddit "HipHopHeads", and then sends out an email notification to the subscribers.

This project was completed over the Summer of 2019 when I had time to dedicate to it. This is a prototype and is in need of additional styling to the HTML.

All Data is stored and archived within a PostgreSQL DB.
